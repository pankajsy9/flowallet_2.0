Flowallet is a web browser based software used for sending FLO (crypto coins) into the crypto account (address) of another user. This is called a transaction.
You can also add comments to a transaction.

User has to open the software using a URL in a web browser. Login is performed after that. Currently the credentials are hardcoded.

History of transactions can be seen. There is no limit to the history.
